  <p>A Texture Group is loaded into RAM when the game starts, unless it&#39;s a <a href="../../Settings/Texture_Information/Dynamic_Textures.htm">Dynamic Texture Group</a>, which is loaded later.</p>
  <p>While in the RAM, the Texture Group stays compressed, as it was on disk.</p>
  <p>When an image from a Texture Group is drawn, or one of the <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Drawing/Textures/texture_prefetch.htm">pre-fetch</a> functions is run, then the Texture Group is decompressed and loaded into VRAM (video memory).</p>
  <p class="note"><span data-conref="Tag_note.hts"> </span>Â Texture decompression is asynchronous on all platforms except GX.games, which might cause stutters as textures are decompressed in-game. To avoid this, ensure your textures are prefetched during loading screens or another inactive parts of your game.</p>
  <p>You can <a href="../../GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Drawing/Textures/texture_flush.htm">flush</a> a Texture Group to remove it from VRAM (this doesn&#39;t remove them from RAM).</p>
